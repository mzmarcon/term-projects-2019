# Felipe Tasoniero

## Part 1

- [Short Paper](tasoniero-proposal.pdf)
- [Presentation Slides](tasoniero-proposal-slides.pdf)

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- [ ] Why do you intend to use experience replay?
- [ ] Do you have a formal or semi formal model of the state? (e.g, what are the features of a state?)

Stylistic comments:

- [ ] Avoid passive voice
- [ ] Keep the abstract to the point, focusing on the 4 key aspects [I suggest here](http://www.meneguzzi.eu/felipe/presentations/paper-writing.pdf)
- [ ] Additionally, moreover, furthermore are often (but not always) an indication of poor structure, get rid of them (e.g. I have not found any on your work, but just in case). If you have multiple points to make, enumerate them and tell the reader at the outset what you want.
- [ ] Almost half a column underlong
