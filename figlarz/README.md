# Gabriel Rossi Figlarz

## Part 1

- [Short Paper](figlarz-proposal.pdf)
- [Presentation Slides](figlarz-proposal-slides.pdf)

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- [ ] You need a formal model of the planning domain  
- [ ] Differentiate (in the paper) Top-K planning and Diverse planning

Stylistic comments:

- [ ] You need to proof read the language, e.g. use [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org), and ideally another person
- [ ] Avoid passive voice
- [ ] Keep the abstract to the point, focusing on the 4 key aspects [I suggest here](http://www.meneguzzi.eu/felipe/presentations/paper-writing.pdf)
- [ ] Additionally, moreover, furthermore are often (but not always) an indication of poor structure, get rid of them (e.g. Additionally, 68% of total population is projected to live in urban areas). If you have multiple points to make, enumerate them and tell the reader at the outset what you want.
- [ ] Almost half a column underlong
