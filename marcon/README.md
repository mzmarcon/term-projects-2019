# Matheus Zampieri Marcon

## Part 1

- [Short Paper](marcon-proposal.pdf)
- [Presentation Slides](marcon-proposal-slides.pdf)

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- [ ] Explain how you generate the state samples (forward backward)
- [ ] Explain how you structure the graphs you provide to the GCN and the options available to you

Stylistic comments:

- [ ] Avoid passive voice
- [ ] Keep the abstract to the point, focusing on the 4 key aspects [I suggest here](http://www.meneguzzi.eu/felipe/presentations/paper-writing.pdf)
- [ ] Additionally, moreover, furthermore are often (but not always) an indication of poor structure, get rid of them (e.g. I have not found any on your work, but just in case). If you have multiple points to make, enumerate them and tell the reader at the outset what you want.
