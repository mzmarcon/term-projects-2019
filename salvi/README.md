## Part 1

Pruning Neural Networks with Lottery Tickets in a MDP Approach

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- [ ] Do you plan to compare the performance of a pruned network with training a similarly structured network from scratch?
- [ ] Use some kind of generalization for the policy (e.g. linear, NN, etc)

Stylistic comments:

- [ ] Avoid passive voice
- [ ] Keep the abstract to the point, focusing on the 4 key aspects [I suggest here](http://www.meneguzzi.eu/felipe/presentations/paper-writing.pdf)
- [ ] Additionally, moreover, furthermore are often (but not always) an indication of poor structure, get rid of them (e.g. Moreover, MDPs are automatic planning algorithms, which means that we are trying to find a policy that is a universal problem solver). If you have multiple points to make, enumerate them and tell the reader at the outset what you want.
